Project Overview: 

This is a website application using Flask and HTML along with some CSS that is a game hosting website where you can go and play games. 

The original scope of the project included being able to play a PyGame game on this website but due to pygbag's unreliability this was undoable from my standpoint,

in terms of my knowledge for translating Python into Web Assembly.

Installation and Setup Instructions:

Clone project

Find app.py

Usage Guide: How users can navigate and use your application.

Run app.py

go to the link outputted by the console

from here you can go straight into a game of snake, or you may log in, clicking on the login button shows you may make an account, the sign up page saves your information into the database in the file.

You may go back into the login page and log in. You may also log out after the fact. There is no other game playable at the moment other than snake. The other images are placeholders.

Testing Procedures: Instructions on how to test your application.

you may test the functionality by making an account, trying to log in, trying to log out, click on all the different images, explore the URLs and HTML files I have in this project, 

explore the database before and after the changes you make. You can also see that the program stops you from making an account with the same email as one thats already in the database.

Contributions and Acknowledgments: Credit any collaborators or sources.
